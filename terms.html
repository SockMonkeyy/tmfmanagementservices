    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span id="year"></span></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the website and services provided by
      <strong>TMF Management Services</strong> (“TMF,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By using this website
      or submitting information to us, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Legal Advice</h2>
    <p>
      TMF Management Services is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. Any information
      on this website is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered legal
      advice. You may wish to consult an attorney regarding your specific situation.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Our Services</h2>
    <p>
      TMF Management Services provides financial asset recovery services, including research,
      documentation preparation, claim assistance, and administrative processing related to
      surplus funds, excess proceeds, and other unclaimed or undistributed funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not guarantee the recovery of funds. All recoveries depend on third-party entities,
      including courts, counties, trustees, or other holders of funds.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Guarantee of Results</h2>
    <p>
      While we make reasonable efforts to assist in locating and recovering funds, we do not
      guarantee that any funds will be found or recovered. Outcomes depend on record availability,
      eligibility, deadlines, and decisions by the relevant authorities.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Fees</h2>
    <p>
      In most cases, TMF Management Services operates on a success-based or contingency-style fee,
      meaning we are only compensated if funds are successfully recovered. Specific fee terms, if
      applicable, will be disclosed separately in a written agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The information you provide is accurate and truthful.</li>
      <li>You have the legal right or authority to pursue the funds in question.</li>
      <li>You will cooperate by providing documents or information reasonably requested.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Agencies</h2>
    <p>
      TMF Management Services works with third parties such as courts, counties, trustees, and
      financial institutions. We do not control these entities and are not responsible for their
      processing times, decisions, or actions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, TMF Management Services shall not be liable for any
      indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or related to the use
      of our website or services.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of our website and services is also subject to our Privacy Policy. We take reasonable
      steps to protect your information, but no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>9. No Attorney-Client or Fiduciary Relationship</h2>
    <p>
      Use of this website or our services does not create an attorney-client relationship or any
      fiduciary relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the website or our services
      after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the applicable
      jurisdiction in which TMF Management Services operates, without regard to conflict of law
      principles.
